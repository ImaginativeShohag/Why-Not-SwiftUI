 # Subjects

 - A subject is a publisher ...
 - ... relays values it receives from other publishers ...
 - ... can be manually fed with new values
 - ... subjects are also subscribers, and can be used with `subscribe(_:)`
 - Unlike typical publishers (which are cold ‚ùÑÔ∏è), subjects are **hot** üî•: they can start emitting values even before a subscriber attaches, and any new subscriber may miss previously emitted values.
